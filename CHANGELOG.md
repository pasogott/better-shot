and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.7] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Screen recording**: Record your screen as MOV video with ScreenCaptureKit. Includes a floating status bar with timer, pause/resume, stop, and discard controls. Access via the new "Record" button in the menu bar or `⌘⇧2`
- **Window recording**: Record a specific window. Uses the same hover-and-click window picker as window screenshots. Access via the "Record Window" button in the menu bar
- **Video editor with effects**: Full video editor with padding, corner radius, shadow, and background picker (solid colors, gradients, macOS wallpapers, custom images) — matching the image editor's inspector sidebar. Trim timeline with thumbnail strip, transport controls, and export with effects baked in
- **Recording settings tab**: Dedicated settings panel for recording preferences — FPS (24/30/60), show cursor, capture audio, and open editor after recording toggles
- **Record Screen keyboard shortcut** (`⌘⇧2`): Configurable global hotkey for screen recording, shown in Capture settings alongside screenshot shortcuts
- **Separate History and Videos tabs**: Screenshots and recordings are now in separate tabs in Settings. History shows only screenshots, Videos shows only recordings — each with their own clear button and appropriate actions (preview for screenshots, open in editor for recordings)
- **Preview panel for recordings**: After stopping a recording, the floating preview overlay appears (same as screenshots). Click it to open the video editor
- **Drag-to-app from preview**: Dragging from the floating preview card now provides the actual file URL, enabling drop into apps like Figma, Slack, and Finder
- **App appearance setting**: Choose between System, Light, and Dark mode in Settings > General > Appearance. The app no longer forces light mode — respects your macOS setting by default
- **Recent menu with sub-menus**: Single "Recent" button in the menu bar with nested "Screenshots" and "Recordings" sub-menus, each with their own clear option

### Fixed

- **Duplicate file on Desktop**: Screenshots no longer create a visible `.base` companion file on the Desktop. The raw source image used for re-editing is now stored internally in Application Support, so only the beautified screenshot appears in the save directory
- **Video export missing background**: Background was invisible in exported videos because `AVMutableVideoCompositionInstruction.backgroundColor` defaulted to opaque black, covering the background layer. Fixed by setting it to clear and applying corner radius via `CAShapeLayer` mask on the video layer
- **Video editor not loading default effects**: Video editor now loads user-configured defaults from `AppPreferences.defaultBeautifierConfig` on open, matching the image editor behavior
- **Window recording not working**: The app runs as `.accessory` (menu bar only), preventing the window picker overlay from receiving mouse events. Fixed by temporarily switching to `.regular` activation policy during window selection
- **Preview pin button position**: Moved the pin button from bottom-left (next to pencil) to bottom-right corner of the preview overlay

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.3.7 (build 10)

## [0.3.6] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Reset to Defaults in Settings**: Added reset buttons throughout settings — "Reset Effects to Defaults" in Default Background section, "Reset All General Settings to Defaults" at the bottom of General tab, "Reset Shortcuts to Defaults" in Keyboard Shortcuts section, and "Reset All Capture Settings to Defaults" at the bottom of Capture tab
- **Preview overlay settings restored**: Position (bottom-right/bottom-left) and auto-dismiss delay (2–15s) are back in Capture settings
- **Shortcut recorder fix**: Recorder now temporarily disables the CGEvent tap so system shortcuts like ⌘⇧4 can be captured without triggering the native macOS screenshot. Uses a local event monitor instead of `keyDown`

### Improved

- **Tab state preserved in settings**: Settings tabs now use ZStack with opacity toggling instead of Group/switch, preserving state when switching between tabs
- **Async history thumbnails**: History tab loads thumbnails asynchronously to avoid blocking the UI on large capture histories

### Fixed

- **Scrollbar hidden in settings**: Removed visible scrollbar from the settings content area
- **Editor & Settings Space switching**: Adopted Screendrop's window presentation pattern — `orderFrontRegardless` before activation policy change prevents macOS from switching to Desktop

### Changed

- Version bumped to 0.3.6 (build 9)

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-06

### Changed

- **Inspector panel moved to the left**: The editor inspector (tools, style, effects, background) is now on the left side of the editor window, canvas on the right
- **Recent captures open preview instead of editor**: Clicking a recent capture in the menu bar now shows the floating preview panel instead of opening the editor directly, matching the normal capture flow
- **README updated**: Removed hardcoded version numbers, added Homebrew install instructions, updated feature descriptions to reflect all current capabilities
- **Landing page updated**: Added color picker, self-timer, QR/barcode scanning, spotlight, customizable shortcuts, workflow extras section, and Homebrew install to the landing page. Removed version number from hero badge
- **CONTRIBUTING.md updated**: Editor flow diagram and key files table updated to reflect left-side inspector panel
- **llms.txt rewritten**: Replaced incorrect tech stack (React/Tauri/TypeScript) with accurate Swift 6/SwiftUI architecture and complete feature listing
- Version bumped to 0.3.5 (build 8)

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Automatic update check on launch**: App checks GitHub releases on startup and shows a toast notification when a new version is available. A blue dot badge appears next to the version label in the menu bar
- **Smart toast after capture**: Toast now shows "Screenshot saved & copied!" when clipboard copy is enabled, or "Screenshot saved!" otherwise

### Changed

- **Simplified capture flow**: Screenshots now always apply default settings (background, padding, corner radius, shadow) and save directly to the gallery. No more editor-first or preview-first workflow — just capture, auto-beautify, and save
- **Removed screenshot mode picker**: The Editor/Gallery segmented control is removed from the menu bar. Default effects configured in Settings are always applied automatically
- **Preview panel restored**: Both a toast notification and the floating preview panel now appear after taking a screenshot
- **Removed overlay settings**: Overlay position and dismiss delay settings removed from Capture settings since the floating preview is no longer shown after capture
- **Recent captures open in editor**: Clicking a recent capture in the menu bar now opens it in the editor instead of showing a floating preview
- Version bumped to 0.3.4 (build 7)

### Fixed

- **Crash on window close**: Fixed `EXC_BREAKPOINT` crash in `_postWindowNeedsUpdateConstraints` caused by `setActivationPolicy(.accessory)` triggering layout updates on a window mid-teardown. Deferred activation policy change to the next run loop iteration for editor, settings, and toast windows
- **Double background on editor open**: Adopted ScreenDrop's base-image sidecar pattern — a `.base.png` copy of the raw capture is saved alongside every beautified output. The editor now resolves to the base image before loading, making it architecturally impossible to apply background/padding/shadow twice, regardless of which URL is passed to the editor
- **Race condition fixes across the codebase**: Fixed multiple race conditions that could cause crashes:
  - Menu bar popover: eliminated Task wrapper in close animation, captured panel reference before nil'ing to prevent use-after-free
  - Editor window delegate: replaced `Task { @MainActor }` with `DispatchQueue.main.async` for deterministic ordering during window teardown
  - Shortcut service: cached shortcuts on main thread to prevent `@MainActor`-isolated property access from CGEvent tap callback thread
  - Toast window: added generation counter to prevent stale animated-dismiss completion handlers from nil'ing a newly created panel
  - Countdown overlay: added cancellation guard against concurrent `showCountdown` calls that could stack overlapping countdowns
  - Preview overlay: cancel pending dismiss task at the start of `show()` to prevent a stale dismiss from hiding a freshly shown preview
  - Menu bar event monitor: replaced `Task { @MainActor }` with `DispatchQueue.main.async` for consistent dispatch ordering

### Removed

- **Screenshot mode preference** (`ScreenshotMode` enum): No longer needed since capture always uses gallery mode with auto-applied defaults
- **"Show floating preview after capture" toggle**: Removed from General settings

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Settings sidebar navigation**: Redesigned preferences from top tabs to a left sidebar with right content panel
- **Keyboard shortcut recorder**: Click any shortcut badge to record a new key combination (press Escape to cancel)
- **Default effects configuration**: Padding, corner radius, shadow, and background are now configurable directly in Settings and persist across sessions
- **Live settings preview**: Default Effects section shows a real-time mini preview of how screenshots will look with current padding, corner radius, shadow, and background
- **macOS wallpapers in settings**: Default Background picker now includes bundled macOS wallpaper thumbnails alongside solid colors and gradients
- **Custom image backgrounds in settings**: "Custom Image..." button in Default Background picker lets you choose any image file as your default background
- **Click preview to open editor**: Clicking the floating preview overlay opens the editor
- **Window capture**: Click-to-select window capture available from the menu bar
- **OCR toast notification**: After OCR copies text to clipboard, a toast confirms "Text copied to clipboard"
- **Color picker toast notification**: After color picker copies hex to clipboard, a toast confirms "#HEXCODE copied to clipboard"
- **Custom menu bar popover**: Replaced SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` with a custom `NSPanel`-based popover with arrow, smooth spring animation, and click-outside-to-dismiss

### Fixed

- **Blur/pixelation invisible in editor**: Fixed `viewScale ≈ 0.16` being multiplied into blur radius and pixel block size, making effects sub-pixel in the canvas preview. Blur radius no longer scales; pixelation computes blocks from view dimensions
- **Spotlight annotation drift**: Canvas preview used `imageFrame` for overlay extent but export used `fullCanvasRect`. Fixed by passing `canvasFrame` through to SpotlightPreview
- **Laggy editor sliders**: Replaced CGContext-based preview render loop with SwiftUI-native layers (CanvasBackgroundView, CanvasScreenshotView), eliminating re-render on every slider change
- **OCR not firing from menu bar**: `dismiss()` was cancelling the async capture task. Fixed by using `Task.detached` so capture survives popover teardown
- **Settings not opening from menu bar**: `@Environment(\.openSettings)` doesn't work from a custom `NSPanel` outside SwiftUI's scene system. Created `SettingsWindowController` that directly manages an `NSWindow` with `PreferencesView`, matching the `EditorWindowController` pattern
- **Editor opens on wrong screen/Space**: `NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps:)` would switch macOS Spaces to where the app was last active (typically Desktop). Added `.moveToActiveSpace` collection behavior to editor and settings windows so they appear on the user's current Space
- **Settings sidebar toggle on wrong side**: Sidebar toggle button appeared on the right side of the title bar when hosted in `NSHostingView`. Fixed by adding an `NSToolbar` with `.toggleSidebar` item to the settings window
- **History icon disappearing**: Menu bar "Recent Captures" and dividers no longer vanish when capture history is empty
- **Background picker in settings**: Cleaner grid layout with proper "None" swatch (strikethrough icon)
- **Preview click-to-edit**: Clicking anywhere on the floating preview (including the hover overlay) now opens the editor
- **Custom background image**: Fixed file picker for custom wallpaper backgrounds in editor
- **GitHub link in About tab**: Corrected URL to `KartikLabhshetwar/better-shot`

### Changed

- **Menu bar icon redesigned**: Converted to a proper template image (black on transparent) that automatically renders white in dark mode and black in light mode, matching native macOS menu bar icon behavior. Icon now fills the full menu bar height instead of being undersized
- **Menu bar redesigned**: Custom `NSPanel` popover with arrow, 2-column grid buttons (Region, Screen, Window, Pick Color), screenshot mode toggle (Editor/Gallery), utility grid (OCR, Recent Captures), and footer grid (Settings, Quit). Shortcut badges on each button
- **About page redesigned**: Left-aligned sectioned layout (Updates, Project, Credits) with horizontal icon+title header. Includes GitHub and X links
- **Settings window enlarged**: 680×560 (was 620×440) so Default Effects preview and sliders are visible without scrolling
- **Settings window title**: Shortened to "Settings" (was "BetterShot Settings") to prevent title bar truncation
- **Toast notifications generalized**: `ToastWindow` now accepts a custom title (was hardcoded "Saved") and supports SF Symbol icons alongside app icons
- **Color picker feedback**: Replaced the cursor-anchored dark HUD panel with a standard toast notification matching the app's toast style
- **Editor canvas rewritten**: SwiftUI-native rendering with `CanvasBackgroundView` and `CanvasScreenshotView` instead of CGContext re-renders. `UnevenRoundedRectangle` for per-corner radius clipping
- **Capture engine rewritten**: Region, fullscreen, and window capture now use the native macOS `screencapture` CLI for maximum reliability across all displays and configurations
- **Layout section improved**: Single "Ratio" row with dropdown, larger alignment grid with 28pt cells and hover highlights
- Default beautifier config now uses a centralized `AppPreferences.defaultBeautifierConfig` accessor across editor, settings, and auto-apply

### Removed

- **Pixelate annotation tool**: Removed from the toolbar (blur tool remains). Keyboard shortcut `P` removed
- **"Save as Default" button**: Removed from editor Effects section; defaults are now managed in Settings
- **Bundled background images**: Removed Wallpapers and Gradients image assets from the editor. Only solid colors, code-generated gradients, macOS assets, and custom images remain
- **Repeat Region shortcut from settings**: Removed from the Keyboard Shortcuts section in Capture settings

## [0.3.2] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **In-app auto-update**: Updates now download the DMG in-app with a progress bar, mount it, replace the running app, and relaunch — no more opening Chrome to download manually. New states: downloading (with cancel), ready to install, installing.
- **Makefile**: `make build`, `make run`, `make dmg`, `make release`, `make clean`, `make lint`, `make test-build`, `make version` for local development and testing without opening Xcode.

### Fixed

- **History tab empty state not centered**: `ContentUnavailableView` was inside a `List`, constraining it to a row. Moved it outside the `List` with `frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)` so it centers properly in the tab.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **Window capture not working**: The window picker used a plain `NSWindow` with borderless style, which can't become key — mouse and keyboard events were unreliable. Replaced with a custom `PickerWindow` subclass that overrides `canBecomeKey`/`canBecomeMain`, matching how the region selection overlay works.
- **Window picker hit-test**: Replaced NSScreen-based coordinate conversion with `CGEvent.location` for reliable cursor-to-window matching across all monitors.
- **Window capture stale reference**: After the picker closes, the app now re-fetches `SCShareableContent` and looks up the selected window by ID to get a fresh `SCWindow` reference before capturing.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- **In-app update checker**: Check for Updates button in Preferences > About that queries GitHub releases API and links to the latest download
- **Version tracking**: `version.json` file at project root for release management
- **Professional annotation system**: Complete rewrite of annotation tools, adapted from Screendrop's implementation
  - **Interactive canvas**: Annotations render as live SwiftUI views — click to select, drag to move, handles to resize
  - **Selection system**: Single select, multi-select (Shift/Cmd+click), marquee drag selection, select all (Cmd+A)
  - **Curved arrows**: Quadratic Bézier arrows with draggable curve control handle and snap-to-straight
  - **Live text editing**: Text annotations use inline NSTextView with full font family, size, bold/italic/underline, and alignment controls
  - **Numbered circles**: Auto-incrementing numbered badges with proper outline and contrast text
  - **Redaction tools**: Pixelate and blur with adjustable density slider and cached preview generation
  - **Resize handles**: Corner handles for shapes, endpoint handles for lines/arrows, curve handle for arrows
  - **Color picker**: 10 named color presets with popover selector + custom ColorPicker
  - **Stroke width picker**: Visual popover with 5 presets (2/4/6/8/12px)
- **Aspect-ratio locking**: Hold Shift while drawing rectangles/ellipses to constrain to square/circle
- **Arrow snap-to-straight**: Arrow curves snap to a straight line when dragged near the start-end axis
- **Color Picker** (Cmd+Shift+C): Uses macOS native `NSColorSampler` for pixel-perfect color picking on any monitor. After picking, a floating HUD shows the color swatch and hex code (#RRGGBB) near the cursor. Hex is copied to clipboard.
- **OCR with QR/Barcode detection**: The OCR capture action now runs both `VNRecognizeTextRequest` and `VNDetectBarcodesRequest` together. Detects QR codes, barcodes, and text in a single pass. QR/barcode payloads appear first in the copied result.
- **Delayed Screenshot countdown overlay**: When the self-timer is set, a fullscreen translucent overlay shows large countdown numbers (3, 2, 1) with scale-down and fade animation. The overlay dismisses before the screenshot fires so it never appears in the capture.
- **Spotlight annotation tool** (G): Darkens everything outside a selected rectangular region to draw focus. Adjustable opacity via the density slider. Uses even-odd fill for both SwiftUI preview and CGContext export rendering.
- **Pinned Floating Screenshots**: Pin any capture as a borderless, always-on-top floating window. Drag to move anywhere, scroll wheel to resize (0.25x–4.0x), hover to reveal close button. Pin from the floating preview card or from the editor. "Unpin All" appears in the menu bar when pins exist.
- **Layout controls**: New LAYOUT section in the editor inspector with aspect ratio dropdown (Auto, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, 9:16) and a visual 3x3 alignment grid picker. Canvas expands to fit the selected ratio without cropping the image.
- **Canvas Expansion**: Annotations can now be drawn into the padding area beyond the screenshot boundaries, enabling margin annotations and callouts outside the image.
- **Repeat Area Capture** (Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+4): Re-captures the exact same screen region as your last region capture without reselecting. Falls back to normal region selection if no previous region exists.
- **Image Overlay** (Cmd+Shift+V): Paste any image from clipboard onto the current screenshot. The pasted image is composited at center, scaled to fit within 80% of the canvas.
- **Option+Drag to Duplicate**: Hold Option and drag any annotation to create a copy. The original stays in place while the duplicate moves with the cursor.
- **Persistent Tool Selection**: The text tool now stays armed after committing a text annotation — you can immediately click to place another text box without reselecting the tool.
- **Expanded keyboard shortcuts**: V (select), R (rectangle), F (filled rectangle), O (ellipse), L (line), A (arrow), D (freehand), N (numbered circle), P (pixelate), B (blur), G (spotlight), T (text)
- **Toast notifications**: Editor shows a brief HUD when exporting ("Exported"), copying ("Copied to clipboard"), or saving defaults ("Saved as default"). Auto-dismisses after 1.5 seconds.
- **Save as Default**: Button in the Effects section saves current padding, corner radius, shadow, background, alignment, and aspect ratio as the default for all new captures.
- **Export preserves in history**: Exported images (with annotations baked in) are added to Recent Captures so reopening shows the final result, not the raw capture.
- **Save directory picker**: Replaced the raw text field with a native macOS folder picker (`NSOpenPanel`) in Preferences.

### Fixed

- **Menu bar icon template rendering**: Changed `template-rendering-intent` from `"original"` to `"template"` so the icon adapts to light mode, dark mode, and high-contrast accessibility settings — matching how native macOS system utilities render menu bar icons
- **Keyboard shortcut override**: Fixed the accessibility permission flow — the CGEvent tap now only registers after accessibility permission is confirmed, with polling to detect when the user grants permission
- **Annotation coordinate system**: Gesture tracking now normalizes against the actual image display rect (accounting for aspect-fit letterboxing), not the full view bounds
- **Blur edge darkening**: Export-time Gaussian blur now pads the crop rect by `ceil(radius * 2)` on all sides before applying the filter, eliminating fringe artifacts at region boundaries
- **Export redaction performance**: Replaced per-item `ctx.makeImage()` (full canvas snapshot for each blur/pixelate region) with a single shared canvas snapshot, reducing export time proportionally to the number of redaction annotations
- **Spotlight export positioning**: Rewrote `AnnotationDrawing` to use explicit `imageRect`/`fullCanvasRect` parameters instead of context translation. Spotlight overlay now correctly covers the full canvas while the cutout aligns with the image position.
- **Annotation export positioning**: All annotations now render at the correct position within the canvas padding area, not offset by the image origin.
- **Multi-monitor capture**: Fullscreen and region capture now correctly identify the display under the cursor using `CGEvent.location` and `CGDisplayBounds` instead of NSScreen coordinate conversion.
- **Settings reactivity**: Capture settings (self timer, overlay position, dismiss delay, export format/quality) now use `@AppStorage` so changes reflect immediately in the UI.
- **Alignment Y-axis**: Fixed inverted Y-axis in the export renderer — clicking "bottom" in the alignment grid now correctly places the image at the bottom of the canvas.

### Changed

- **Menu bar UI redesigned**: Grouped by intent — "Open Last Capture" quick access at top, capture modes (Region, Full Screen, Window), utilities (OCR, Color Picker), contextual actions (Unpin All when pins exist), Recent Captures submenu (up to 8 items). Removed "Check for Updates" from menu (lives in Preferences > About). Shortened labels.
- **Inspector panel redesigned**: Sidebar with sections for Tools, Style, Text, Effects, Layout, and Background — each with proper spacing, section headers, and dividers
- **Canvas rendering**: Annotations now render directly as SwiftUI views on the canvas (not baked into a preview image), enabling real-time interaction without re-render delays
- **Live beautifier preview**: Canvas shows the full rendered preview (background, padding, shadow, corner radius) with a 30ms debounced render pipeline. Redundant re-renders are skipped when config hasn't changed.
- **Performance optimizations**: Cached font family list (static lazy), TransparencyGrid rasterized via `.drawingGroup()`, arrow hit-test sampling halved (32→16 points), text style dirty-check guards redundant `setAttributes` calls, GPU memory cleanup after blur export
- Version bumped to 0.3.0
- Deployment target remains macOS 14.0
- Simplified BetterShotDelegate — removed all video recording callback and frame extraction code

### Removed

- **Screen recording**: Removed ScreenRecorder, VideoProcessor, RecordingControlPanel, and the bundled videokit binary — video features will return in a future release
- **Old annotation system**: Replaced `ColorSwatch`, `StrokeWidth` enum, `AnnotationGestureView`, and basic `AnnotationItem` with the full interactive model

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-02

  - Post-recording compression via videokit (FFmpeg)
  - Recordings saved to user's configured save directory
- **Preview overlay with editor access**: Floating preview card appears after capture
  - Hover to reveal actions: edit (pencil), delete, dismiss
  - Copy and Save pill buttons
  - Draggable thumbnail
  - Clicking pencil icon opens the annotation editor
- **Annotation editor window**: Opens from preview overlay with full beautifier controls
  - Switches app to regular activation policy (visible in Dock/Cmd-Tab) while editing

  - Cmd+Shift+3 = Capture Screen
  - Cmd+Shift+4 = Capture Region
  - Cmd+Shift+5 = Capture Window
  - Cmd+Shift+6 = Toggle Screen Recording
  - Cmd+Shift+O = OCR Region
- **Bundled background images**: Wallpapers, mesh gradients, and macOS assets now ship inside the app bundle
- **videokit bundled**: Go-based FFmpeg wrapper included in the app for video compression

### Fixed

- **Background images not loading in editor**: Resources weren't being copied into the app bundle; fixed project config and file lookup to use direct path construction
- **Screenshot sound**: Now plays the actual macOS screenshot sound (`Screen Capture.aif`) instead of the generic "Blow" sound
- **Editor image caching**: Added `.onChange(of: imageURL)` and `.id()` to prevent stale images when editor window is reused

### Changed
